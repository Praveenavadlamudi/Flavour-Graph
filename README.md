2. **Algorithm Processing**:  
   - **Greedy**: Finds recipes with the highest number of matches.  
   - **Backtracking**: Explores multiple combinations to suggest all possible recipes.  
3. **Output**:  
   - Recipes you can make with available ingredients.  
   - Missing ingredients for each recipe.  
   - Suggested substitutions for missing items.
